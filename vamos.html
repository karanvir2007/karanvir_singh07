<h2>
I was assigned to two different teams. <br><br>
During the first days of the intership, I worked with the administrative team, where I did customer service. <br><br>
In the second part, I joined the repair team, where I dealed with products returned by customers due to manufacturing defects or damage. <br><br>
In both teams, I was supervised by the same co-manager.
